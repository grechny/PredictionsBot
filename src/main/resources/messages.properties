help=<b>Welcome to Erste Liga bot!</b>\n\nThe bot allows you to make predictions on the results of football matches. The prediction can be made at any time before the start of the match. Depending on the results of the match, points are awarded for full-time (extra time does not count) according to the following principle:\n\n- 2 points if the winner is guessed;\n- 3 points if the winner and goal difference are guessed;\n- 5 points for the exact score of the match.\n\nIn addition, the results of one of the matches of the round can be doubled.\n\nYou can join our <a href="@erste_liga">Erste Liga chat</a> for feedback and discussions.\n\n<u>List of available commands</u>:\n\n/competitions - manage the list of leagues\n/predictions - make predictions\n/results - see results archive\n/leagues - manage user leagues\n/timezone - set default time zone\n/language - change default language\n/username {new_name} - change user name
